        Here are a few quick facts to make your travel safe and easy to Kasol. Kasol is a Hills & Mountains destination. The best time to visit Kasol is March, April, May and June. Since this is the peak season expect a little crowd during this time. July, August and September period experiences moderate weather. So, you can easily avoid facing a large gathering.
        <br>
        In peak season the weather is warm days and cool nights, whereas in off-season the weather is intense cold with night temperatures falling below freezing point. Weather in moderate season is damp weather with possible landslides. During Badoh Mela, Fagdi Mela,… a large number of tourists flock together. The festivals are celebrated in the month of August, February,... consecutively. So, if you are fond of bustling streets and localities, choose this time of the year to travel.
